# Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for training and evaluation contains various medical attributes of individuals, such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant factors. The machine learning model is trained on this dataset to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on their attributes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset . It contains several attributes for each patient, including both numerical and categorical features. The target variable indicates the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
Step 1:git clone https://github.com/inbatamilan573/Heart_diseases_prediction.git ; cd Heart_diseases_prediction
 Step 2:  pip install -r requirements.txt ; python app.py
```

Once the application is running, you can access it through your web browser. Simply navigate to the web to use the heart disease prediction tool.

1.Enter the required medical attributes for the patient.
2.Click on the "Submit" button.
3.The model will provide a prediction on the likelihood of heart disease based on the entered attributes.

## Model Training
The machine learning model used in this project is trained using the dataset mentioned above. The training process involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The trained model is then used for making predictions in real-time.
## Result
 This project aimed to develop a predictive model for heart disease using advanced machine-learning techniques.  Notably, the Random Forest algorithm, optimized through hyperparameter tuning, emerged as a key player, achieving a noteworthy 73% accuracy rate. The project's success highlights the potential of machine learning in early detection and intervention for heart disease.
